### Abstract

During the last years, a number of formal specification languages for knowledge-based systems has 
been developed. Characteristics for knowledge-based systems are a complex knowledge base and an inference 
engine which uses this knowledge to solve a given problem. Specification languages for knowledge-based 
systems have to cover both aspects. They have to provide the means to specify a complex and large 
amount of knowledge and they have to provide the means to specify the dynamic reasoning behavior of 
a knowledge-based system. This paper focuses on the second aspect. For this purpose, we survey existing 
approaches for specifying dynamic behavior in related areas of research. In fact, we have taken approaches 
for the specification of information systems (Language for Conceptual Modeling and TROLL), approaches for 
the specification of database updates and logic programming (Transaction Logic and Dynamic Database Logic) 
and the generic specification framework of Abstract State Machines.
