Since October 2021, I am a senior software developer at the [Software Improvement Group](https://www.softwareimprovementgroup.com) (SIG) in Amsterdam, after having been a consultant since 2013 at SIG. The Software Improvement Group is a management consultancy that focuses on software-related challenges. SIG provides management with fact-based insight into their current IT situation, along with razor-sharp, pragmatic and highly actionable recommendations on how to improve on that situation. We know how to govern software projects effectively, when to invest in quality improvement, how to rationalise, and how to control cost. By consolidating low-level technical analysis and high-level financial analysis we make sure our recommendations are the best fit for the specific business needs of our clients.

From 2000 until most of 2013, I was assistant professor in the Information Systems Group, Department of Computer Science, University of Twente, the Netherlands. In 2013, the Information Systems Group became part of a new group called [Services and Cyber Security](https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/scs/).

My main interest are software quality and maintainability, IT conflict resolution, enterprise architecture and IT governance. At University of Twente, I focused on enterprise architecture and IT governance, which I view as two essential prerequisites for effective and efficient use of information technology in organisations.

At University of Twente, Enterprise architecture and IT governance have been represented in my most important tasks and activities:

- Creating knowledge. As assistant professor, I was involved in research projects in the area of architecture maturity and IT project management.
- Disseminating knowledge. At the University of Twente, I was responsible for three courses, two of which were about enterprise architecture and IT governance. I have supervised over 80 M.Sc. students and a number of Ph.D. students.
- Memberships. I participate in The Dutch Forum for Architecture in the Digital World (NAF, which is now called [DANW](https://www.danw.nl/)) and in the new Dutch Forum for IT Governance. From 2009 until 2016, I have been a member (and since 2014, chairman) of the program committee of the Dutch National Conference on Architecture in the Digital World (in Dutch: Landelijk Architectuur Congres, nowadays called [Digital Architecture Design Day](https://www.digitalarchitecturedesignday.com/)).
